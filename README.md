# Fall 2019 - Winter 2020 Undergraduate Thesis Project
**Title:** ClassroomCompanion\
**Desc:** A website built to assist teachers with mundane teaching tasks.

## Planned Widgets:
Order of importance (Most to least):
```
NEED - A Group Maker that would take in student names and randomly make groups
NEED - An Attendance tracker; self explanatory.
NEED - A Whiteboard Widget that would take in pdf/pptx and would let the user draw over them and export them as pdfs.
NEED - A Student Performance tracker, would take in student marks from an excel sheet and create a chart of their performance based off that to send to the parents/student (This was split into Grade Tracker and Student Performance Tracker)
WANT - An email generator to easily fill in student feedback reports to send to parents/student
WANT - A Checklist of todo items that gets categorized in a Gantt chart so the user can plan out their semester/year in a simple GUI.
WANT - An anonymous feedback part of the site that can use a short url for student feedback
```
